# Orderly Asynchronous Javascript Loader for WordPress

This plugin does one job and that's it. It takes all the JavaScript queued to your WordPress footer, dequeues it, and loads it through another script that has been defered and attached asynchronously. 

This way, you can reap the page speed benefits of asynchronous code, but still have all your code which depends on load-order load properly. 

Have fun, submit issues.

### USE AT YOUR OWN RISK

This plugin is intended for very specific use-cases and very well may **BREAK YOUR WEBSITE**.
